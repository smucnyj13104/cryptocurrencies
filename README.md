# cryptocurrencies
## Purpose
- The purpose of this challenge was to use clustering to identify groups of crytocurrencies.

## Results
- The elbow plot suggested there were 4 clusters of crypto. 2 of the clusters were uniquely identifiable by the total coins mined (<.1 for TurtleCoin and 1 for bittorrent) vs. total coin supply (1 for turtlecoin and 1 for bittorrent).
- The other 2 clusters were different from their principle componets, although not distinctly so from the total coins mined or total coin supply.
